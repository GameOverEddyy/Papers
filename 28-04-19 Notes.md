## Notes on 'A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning'

### Terminology:

* Classifier - A system that inputs a vector of discrete/continuous _feature values_ and outputs a single discrete value called a _class_ or _category_
* Learner - A learner inputs a _training set_ of _examples_ and outputs a _classifier_. 
* Hypothesis Space - The set of _classifiers_ a _learner_ can possibly learn. Anything outside the _hypothesis space_ cannot be learned. 
* Objective Function/Scoring Function - Used to distinguish good classifiers from bad ones. E.g, mean average errors.
* Overfitting - 
* Underfitting - 
* Bias - 
* Variance - 
* Reguarization Term - 
* Multiple Testing - 
* Model Ensembles - 
* Bagging - 
* Boosting -
